This repository contains my C projects. I will try to implement basic data structures using this language. 

## Albums file generator
This project reads the albums you enter and writes them to the albums.txt file. This file has already been created, there you can see an example of how this program works. The albums are stored in a dynamic array.

Folder of this project: `albumGenerator`

Later i will add new projects with new datatypes.
