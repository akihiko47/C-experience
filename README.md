This repository contains my C projects. I will try to implement different data structures and algorithms using this language. 

## Albums file generator
This project reads the albums you enter and writes them to the `albums.txt` file. This file has already been created, there you can see an example of how this program works. The album structures are stored in a dynamic array.

Folder of this project: `albumGenerator`

## Integers from string
This program can pull a number from your string and convert it to int type. This project is an experiment with simple data types. Example of how the program works: `a12b34c5d` will be converted to `12345`.

Function description: `int intfromstr(char * str);`

Later i will add new projects with new data structures.
